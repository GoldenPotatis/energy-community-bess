1. Research Question
How can Europe strengthen its critical mineral supply chains for sustainable technologies through enhanced circularity practices while addressing geopolitical vulnerabilities in a rapidly changing global context? This project focuses on developing comprehensive frameworks for enhancing critical mineral circularity while strengthening Europe's resilience to geopolitical disruptions, thereby supporting continued technological innovation and sustainable development.
The global transition toward sustainable energy systems and digital technologies has intensified demand for critical mineral resources, including lithium (Li), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), manganese (Mg), and rare earth elements. However, this surge in demand presents significant challenges related to supply security, environmental impacts, and geopolitical tensions. With increasing complexity in global supply chains, Europe faces particular vulnerabilities due to its high import dependency, supply concentration in specific regions, and growing geopolitical rivalries. Recent regional geopolitical incidents such as Russia-Ukraine war, and global instability such as US-China confrontation, has placed the EU at a very vulnerable front. The recent bankcrupcy of NorthVolt further consolidates China's dominance in global critical minerals markets and the corresponding downstream industiral products such as batteries and electric vehicles. The EU's lagging position in the AI competition behind the US and China further poses a challenge to its vision of a sustainable and smart future. It is crucial for Europe, particularly Sweden, to assess the current landscape and strategically reposition itself to diversify and mitigate risks in the supply chains of critical minerals essential for emerging sustainable technologies.
2. State of Knowledge
Critical minerals constitute the foundation of modern sustainable technologies, powering everything from clean energy systems to digital infrastructure. However, research shows that global supply chains for these materials face mounting pressures related to environmental impacts, social concerns, and geopolitical risks. Current literature explores several dimensions of this challenge:
Supply chain dynamics: Studies demonstrate that critical mineral value chains are characterized by high geographic concentration, with China dominating the processing capacity for many materials, and significant portions of mining reserves controlled by specific countries in South Amarica and Africa. This concentration creates inherent vulnerabilities in global supply networks to downstream manufacturers and end-users, especially during periods of geopolitical tensions or disruptions.
Circular economy frameworks: Researhes mostly encompasses recyling and reporposing. Recyling methods include mechanical, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical recycling, each with advantages and limitations. Recent advancements have shown promising recovery rates for high-value materials such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements. Additionally, designs that facilitate material recovery can significantly enhance recycling efficiency and economic viability. The potential for repurposing critical mineral-containing products, particularly energy storage systems, has been explored as a viable strategy to extend material usage before final recycling (also known as secondary life applications). However, successful implementation requires robust assessment methodologies to ensure safety and performance standards.
Policy landscapes: The EU’s Battery Directive and Critical Raw Materials Act exemplify policy frameworks aimed at promoting responsible production, consumption, and end-of-life management of critical minerals. These regulatory approaches drive innovation in recycling technologies, support sustainable sourcing, and encourage development of circular business models.
Geopolitical dimensions: Emerging research highlights how critical minerals have become instruments of geopolitical competition and leverage. Studies have documented increasing state intervention in mineral markets, strategic stockpiling, investment restrictions, and export controls as nations seek to secure supply chains for strategic technologies.
Despite this substantial body of knowledge, significant gaps remain in understanding how circular economy practices can mitigate geopolitical vulnerabilities while addressing environmental and social concerns across the entire critical mineral value chain. Especially in recent years, black swan incidents such as the Covid-19 pandemic, Ukraine-Russian war, and the political instability of the current US administration all exert great uncertainty to existing reseserch outcomes. There lacks a new framework that thinks beyond the past theme of globalism, rather can take in the high-risk substaintial-consiquential di-globalisation scenarios to propose regional resilience, particularly from Europe’s perspective.
3. Scientific Contributions
This project will advance scientific knowledge through several innovative contributions:
Integration of geopolitical analysis with material flow assessment
Traditional Material Flow Analysis (MFA) approaches for critical minerals have often overlooked geopolitical dimensions. This project introduces a novel methodological framework that integrates geopolitical risk factors—including trade restrictions, political instability, and strategic competition—directly into material flow modeling. This integration will produce more realistic assessments of supply vulnerabilities and identify potential intervention points for enhancing resilience.
Conflict-sensitive circularity models at global perspetive with European focus
Recent global disruptions like the Russia-Ukraine war and regional incidents like the bankcrupcy of Northvolt have fundamentally altered critical mineral supply chains. This project will develop adaptive circularity models that incorporate lessons from these disruptions, addressing how circular economy strategies must evolve in response to geopolitical instabilities and rapid shifts in global trade patterns. These models will help identify circular economy practices that enhance resilience during periods of heightened geopolitical tension. 
While much existing research limits its scope to specific regions, this project adopts a truly global analytical framework that examines intercontinental material flows, cross-border dependencies, and transcontinental policy impacts. This expanded perspective acknowledges the reality that critical mineral markets operate globally while providing specific recommendations for strengthening European resilience and circularity. The project will develop global scenario models that exceed regional confines and account for the dynamic relationships between European policies and global market responses.
Environmental-social-geopolitical impact assessment framework
Current research often neglects the distributional impacts of critical mineral extraction, processing, and disposal across different regions and communities. This project will develop an integrated assessment framework that evaluates environmental damage, social inequities, and geopolitical consequences associated with different circularity strategies. This comprehensive approach will enable policymakers to identify solutions that balance environmental protection, social justice, and geopolitical security. The project will synthesize insights from diverse international bodies, including industrial associations, policy forums, and research institutions, to provide a more holistic understanding of critical mineral circularity challenges. By incorporating these varied perspectives, the research will bridge gaps between technical, economic, and geopolitical approaches to critical mineral management, revealing potential synergies and conflicts between different stakeholder priorities.
